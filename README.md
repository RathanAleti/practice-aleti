###### Imagine Dragons

I like Imagine Dragons because their music is very motivating and easy to connect to. Their songs have strong beats and meaningful lyrics that talk about confidence, struggles, and never giving up. I also like how their music mixes rock and pop, which makes it exciting to listen to while **studying** or **working out**.
